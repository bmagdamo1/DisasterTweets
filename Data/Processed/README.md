These cleaned data files take in the text from the Tweets and remove links, emojis, punctuation, and stop words.  The stop word dictionary used was from the Python 
package nltk set to "english".  We also converted all Tweets to lower case.  The code for the cleaned data can be found in "CleanData.ipynb".
